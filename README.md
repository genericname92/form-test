This is a basic form app with generated a quiz for users. I cut out the entire front end setup thing because of time constraints, but then I realized that I didn't really remember how to cleanly put javascript in simple html.erb files either. The next steps would be adding a done page and cleaning up the ui portion of it, as well as adding admin dashboard support to flesh out the questions needing to be asked. You could also make 1 question per page and have some sort of state in the front end application.. but that takes more setup time. Also you need a way to aggregate the test answers so that someone can actually score it. I added auth stuff because it didn't really make sense to me to create tests and answers without some sort of user being associated with it.

In terms of tech choices, rails seemed like the best way to bootstrap this thing quickly with a relational database. I didn't see any reason to not have a relational database for this type of app, so I used postgres along with Ruby on Rails.
